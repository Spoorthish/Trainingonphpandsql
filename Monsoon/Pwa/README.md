![configuration options](doc/sys-config.jpg)

### Offline Page
In _Stores > Configuration > Monsoon > PWA_ select the page you wish to use as your offline notification page.   
Alternatively use the default one provided by this module.

## Customisation
In your Magento theme, override the images and PWA app details found in:
- Monsoon/Pwa/view/frontend/web/images/favicons
- Monsoon/Pwa/view/frontend/web/manifest.icon

For generating the correct icons there are useful tools such as 
a [favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and [maskable icon editor](https://maskable.app/editor).

### Configure Service Worker
Most PWA features can be adjusted added in the service-worker file.    
Simply override `Monsoon_Pwa/view/frontend/templates/service-worker.js.phtml` in your theme to customise.
